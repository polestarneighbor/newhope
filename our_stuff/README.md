This is a class project for CSCI 5471 at the University of Minnesota, Spring 2017.
We (Hannah Davis, Patrick Skoglund, Tyler Westland, and Christopher Koshiol) are
attempting to extend the attack described in "Leakage of signal function with
reused keys in RWLE key exchange" by Ding et al. to the NEWHOPE implementation
of the RWLE key exchange (with the tweak that all keys are cached indefinitely)
(which obviously breaks the scheme and isn't currently in use anyway).
